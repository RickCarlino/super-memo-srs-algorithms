# SM2 In Code

I am reviewing ["Anki SRS Algorithm - Spaced Repetition Explained with Code" by Julien Sobczak](https://www.juliensobczak.com/inspect/2022/05/30/anki-srs.html) and am porting the examples to Typescript as I go.

The article is excellent and will be easier to understand by adding types, but more importantly, re-implementing the algorithms by hand helps me understand what is going on.

# Progress

 * Dec 31 stopped at "SM-2" section. SM-0 implementation needs testing because I am unsure that it works.
